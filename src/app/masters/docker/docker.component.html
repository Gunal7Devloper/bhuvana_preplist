    <h3 class="question-style">1. What is Docker?</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Docker</b> is an open-source platform used to develop, ship, and run applications in <b>lightweight, portable
        containers.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      ðŸ”¹ In Simple Terms:
      Docker packages your application <b>along with everything it needs</b> (code, libraries, dependencies, system
      tools) into
      a single <b>container</b>
      that can run <b>anywhere</b>â€”on your machine, in testing, or in production.
    </p>
    <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
    <p>
      Container: A lightweight, standalone, and executable unit that includes all application dependencies.

      Image: A read-only template used to create containers (like a blueprint).

      Dockerfile: A script with instructions to build a Docker image.

      Docker Hub: A cloud-based registry where Docker images can be stored and shared.

    <p>
      Docker is a platform that allows developers to package applications into containersâ€”lightweight, portable units
      that include everything the application needs to run. These containers can be run consistently across any
      environment, whether it's development, testing, or production. Docker helps eliminate environment-related issues
      and simplifies deployment. Iâ€™ve used Docker to containerize Angular frontends and Spring Boot backends, ensuring
      they work the same on every machine.

      <strong>Advanced Answer (With Technical Depth):</strong>
    </div>
    <p>
      Docker uses containerization to isolate applications and their dependencies from the host system. A Docker image
      is built from a <code>Dockerfile</code>, which defines how the container is set up. The container runs from that
      image and can be deployed on any system that has Docker installed. Iâ€™ve used <code>docker-compose</code> to manage
      multi-container applicationsâ€”for example, running Angular, a Spring Boot API, and PostgreSQL database together
      during development and testing.

    <h3>Tips for Answering:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Tailor the answer to your project experience (e.g., Angular + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL).</li>
      <li>Mention tools youâ€™ve used: <code>Dockerfile</code>, <code>docker-compose</code>, <code>Docker Hub</code>.</li>
      <li>Be ready to explain:
        <ul>
          <li>How you build a Docker image</li>
          <li>How you run a container</li>
          <li>How Docker helps in CI/CD or DevOps workflows</li>
        </ul>
