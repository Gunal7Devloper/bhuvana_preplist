  <h3 class="question-style">1. What is DevOps?</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>DevOps</strong> is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that aims to unify and
    automate the work of software development (<strong>Dev</strong>) and IT operations (<strong>Ops</strong>).
    The goal is to shorten the development lifecycle, deliver high-quality software continuously,
    and improve collaboration between development and operations teams.
  </p>
  <p>It focuses on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Automation of infrastructure and workflows</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring and performance feedback</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Collaboration and shared responsibilities</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    DevOps promotes using tools like Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, and cloud platforms like
    AWS or Azure to automate and streamline the software delivery process.

  <h3 class="question-style">2. Why did you choose DevOps?</h3>
    <p>
      I chose DevOps because it bridges the gap between development and operations,
      allowing me to work across the entire software delivery lifecycle â€” from coding
      and building to deploying and monitoring. I enjoy automation, problem-solving,
      and improving efficiency, and DevOps gives me the tools and mindset to do that at scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also aligns with my passion for continuous learning and working with modern tools like
      Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud platforms. DevOps isnâ€™t just about tools â€”
      it's about culture, collaboration, and delivering value faster and more reliably, which
      makes the work both challenging and rewarding.

        "Coming from a [developer/sysadmin/tester] background, I found DevOps a natural
        evolution that allowed me to expand my impact by enabling automation,
        better communication, and faster delivery."
